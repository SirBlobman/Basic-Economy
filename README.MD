# Basic Economy

An extremely basic Vault economy plugin for Spigot, Paper, and Folia servers.

## Requirements

- Java 8
- [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper), or [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) 1.8.8-1.19.4
- [BlueSlimeCore](https://hangar.papermc.io/SirBlobman/BlueSlimeCore)
- Vault


## Folia

If your server is running Folia, you need a version of Vault that supports it.
I have created one here, but there may be others.
